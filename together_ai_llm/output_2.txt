We are to explain why a projectile launched at 45 degrees achieves the maximum range (horizontal distance) in the absence of air resistance.

 The motion of a projectile can be broken down into two independent components: horizontal and vertical.

 Horizontal motion: 
   The horizontal velocity (v_x) remains constant because there is no horizontal acceleration (assuming no air resistance). 
   So, v_x = v0 * cos(θ), where v0 is the initial speed and θ is the launch angle.

 Vertical motion:
   The vertical motion is affected by gravity. The initial vertical velocity is v0 * sin(θ). 
   The acceleration due to gravity (g) acts downward, so the vertical velocity changes with time.

 The time of flight (T) is the total time the projectile is in the air. It can be found by considering the vertical motion. 
 The projectile goes up and then comes back down. The time to reach the maximum height is when the vertical velocity becomes zero:
   v_y = v0 * sin(θ) - g * t = 0   =>   t = (v0 * sin(θ)) / g
 Since the time to go up equals the time to come down (symmetry), the total time of flight is:
   T = 2 * (v0 * sin(θ)) / g

 The horizontal distance (range, R) is the horizontal velocity multiplied by the total time of flight:
   R = v_x * T = (v0 * cos(θ)) * [2 * (v0 * sin(θ)) / g]
   => R = (2 * v0^2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ)) / g

 We can use the trigonometric identity: 2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ) = sin(2θ)
   So, R = (v0^2 * sin(2θ)) / g

 Now, we want to maximize R with respect to θ. Notice that v0 and g are constants. Therefore, R is proportional to sin(2θ).

 The sine function has a maximum value of 1, which occurs when 2θ = 90° (or π/2 radians). Therefore, θ = 45°.

 Hence, the maximum range is achieved when θ = 45°.

 However, note that this is true only when the launch and landing are at the same height and in the absence of air resistance.

 Let's write the range formula again:
   R = (v0^2 * sin(2θ)) / g

 Since sin(2θ) is maximized at 1 when 2θ = 90° (so θ=45°), then indeed 45° gives the maximum range.

 Example: 
   If θ = 0°, then sin(0)=0, so R=0.
   If θ = 90°, then sin(180°)=0, so R=0.
   If θ = 45°, then sin(90°)=1, so R = v0^2 / g, which is the maximum.

 Therefore, the angle of 45° produces the greatest distance.

Throwing a projectile at a 45° angle maximizes the horizontal distance (range) due to the interplay between the horizontal and vertical components of motion, governed by the equations of projectile motion. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### 1. **Range Formula**:
   The range \( R \) of a projectile launched with initial speed \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \) is given by:
   \[
   R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
   \]
   where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( \sin(2\theta) \) is the sine of twice the launch angle.

### 2. **Key Insight**:
   - The range \( R \) depends on \( \sin(2\theta) \).
   - The sine function reaches its maximum value of 1 when its argument is 90°:
     \[
     \sin(90^\circ) = 1
     \]
   - Setting \( 2\theta = 90^\circ \) gives:
     \[
     \theta = 45^\circ
     \]

### 3. **Why 45° is Optimal**:
   - **Horizontal velocity** (\( v_x = v_0 \cos\theta \)) decreases as \( \theta \) increases beyond 45° because the projectile spends more time moving vertically than horizontally.
   - **Vertical velocity** (\( v_y = v_0 \sin\theta \)) increases with \( \theta \), extending the **time of flight** (\( T = \frac{2v_0 \sin\theta}{g} \)).
   - At 45°, the balance is perfect:
     - The horizontal velocity is still substantial (\( \cos 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707 \)).
     - The vertical velocity is high enough to ensure a long flight time (\( \sin 45^\circ = 0.707 \)).
   - This balance maximizes the product of horizontal velocity and time of flight (\( R = v_x \cdot T \)).

### 4. **Comparison with Other Angles**:
   - **Lower angles (e.g., 30°)**:
     - Higher horizontal velocity (\( \cos 30^\circ \approx 0.866 \)).
     - Shorter flight time due to lower vertical velocity (\( \sin 30^\circ = 0.5 \)).
     - Result: Shorter range.
   - **Higher angles (e.g., 60°)**:
     - Lower horizontal velocity (\( \cos 60^\circ = 0.5 \)).
     - Longer flight time (\( \sin 60^\circ \approx 0.866 \)).
     - Result: Shorter range despite longer air time.
   - **Extreme cases**:
     - \( \theta = 0^\circ \): No vertical component, projectile falls immediately (\( R = 0 \)).
     - \( \theta = 90^\circ \): No horizontal component, projectile goes straight up/down (\( R = 0 \)).

### 5. **Mathematical Proof**:
   Substitute \( \theta = 45^\circ \) into the range formula:
   \[
   R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(90^\circ)}{g} = \frac{v_0^2 \cdot 1}{g} = \frac{v_0^2}{g}.
   \]
   For any other \( \theta \), \( \sin(2\theta) < 1 \), so \( R \) is smaller.

### 6. **Assumptions**:
   - This holds for **ideal conditions**: no air resistance, launch and landing at the same height, and constant \( g \).

### Conclusion:
At 45°, the projectile achieves an optimal trade-off between horizontal speed and flight duration, resulting in the maximum range. This is mathematically confirmed by the maximum value of \( \sin(2\theta) \) at \( \theta = 45^\circ \).

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking why throwing a projectile at a 45° angle produces the greatest possible distance. This is related to the physics of projectile motion.

## Step 2: Recall the equations of motion
In projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical components of the motion are independent. The horizontal motion is uniform, with a constant velocity determined by the initial horizontal velocity. The vertical motion is under the sole influence of gravity, and is uniformly accelerated.

## Step 3: Consider the trajectory of the projectile
The trajectory of a projectile under the sole influence of gravity is a parabola. The maximum height of the projectile occurs when the vertical velocity is zero. The maximum range occurs when the angle of projection is 45°, as this angle ensures that the vertical and horizontal components of the velocity are equal.

## Step 4: Consider the effect of gravity on the range
Gravity has a greater effect on the vertical component of the velocity than on the horizontal component. As the projectile rises, its vertical velocity decreases due to gravity, causing it to spend more time in the air. However, the horizontal velocity remains constant, allowing the projectile to travel a greater distance.

## Step 5: Analyze the outcome
When the projectile is thrown at a 45° angle, the vertical and horizontal components of the velocity are equal, and the effect of gravity on the range is minimized. As a result, the projectile travels the greatest possible distance.

The final answer is: There is no final numerical answer to this problem.
