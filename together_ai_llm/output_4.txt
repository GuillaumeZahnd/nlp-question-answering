We are to explain why a 45-degree angle gives the maximum range for a projectile without using external sources.

 Recall the equations of motion for a projectile launched with initial velocity `v0` at an angle `θ` to the horizontal.

 The horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity are:
   vx0 = v0 * cos(θ)
   vy0 = v0 * sin(θ)

 The time of flight for the projectile can be found by considering the vertical motion. The projectile goes up and then comes back down. The time to reach the maximum height is when the vertical velocity becomes zero:
   vy = vy0 - g*t = 0   =>   t_up = vy0 / g = (v0 * sin(θ)) / g

 The total time of flight is twice that (since the motion is symmetric):
   T = 2 * t_up = 2 * (v0 * sin(θ)) / g

 The horizontal distance (range) is the horizontal velocity multiplied by the total time of flight:
   R = vx0 * T = (v0 * cos(θ)) * [2 * (v0 * sin(θ)) / g]
     = (2 * v0^2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ)) / g

 We can use the trigonometric identity: sin(2θ) = 2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ)
   => R = (v0^2 * sin(2θ)) / g

 Therefore, the range R is proportional to sin(2θ). The sine function has a maximum value of 1, which occurs when its argument is 90 degrees. So:
   sin(2θ) = 1   =>   2θ = 90°   =>   θ = 45°

 Hence, the maximum range is achieved when θ = 45°.

 However, note that this derivation assumes no air resistance and a flat, level ground. Also, the acceleration due to gravity `g` is constant.

 Therefore, without any external forces, the 45-degree angle gives the maximum range because it maximizes the value of sin(2θ) to 1, which is the maximum possible value for the sine function.

To understand why a 45° launch angle maximizes the distance (range) of a projectile, consider the fundamental equations of projectile motion. Assume ideal conditions: no air resistance, uniform gravitational acceleration \(g\), and launch and landing at the same height.  

The range \(R\) of a projectile launched with initial velocity \(v_0\) at an angle \(\theta\) is given by:  
\[ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} \]  
This formula derives from the horizontal and vertical components of motion:  
- **Horizontal velocity**: \(v_{0x} = v_0 \cos\theta\) (constant).  
- **Vertical velocity**: \(v_{0y} = v_0 \sin\theta\) (affected by gravity).  
The time of flight \(T\) is determined by the vertical motion. The projectile ascends and descends symmetrically, so:  
\[ T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g} \]  
The range is the horizontal distance covered in time \(T\):  
\[ R = (v_0 \cos\theta) \cdot T = (v_0 \cos\theta) \cdot \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g} = \frac{2 v_0^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta}{g} \]  
Using the trigonometric identity \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta\), this simplifies to:  
\[ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} \]  

The range \(R\) depends on \(\sin(2\theta)\). The sine function reaches its maximum value of 1 when its argument is 90°:  
\[ \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \]  
Thus, \(\sin(2\theta)\) is maximized when:  
\[ 2\theta = 90^\circ \implies \theta = 45^\circ \]  
At \(\theta = 45^\circ\), \(\sin(2 \cdot 45^\circ) = \sin(90^\circ) = 1\), giving:  
\[ R_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0^2}{g} \]  

### Why other angles fall short:  
- **Shallow angles (e.g., 30°)**:  
  Horizontal velocity is high, but vertical velocity is low, resulting in a short flight time.  
  Example: \(\theta = 30^\circ \implies 2\theta = 60^\circ \implies \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.866 < 1\).  
- **Steep angles (e.g., 60°)**:  
  Vertical velocity is high, extending flight time, but horizontal velocity is low.  
  Example: \(\theta = 60^\circ \implies 2\theta = 120^\circ \implies \sin(120^\circ) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.866 < 1\).  

### Key Insight:  
The 45° angle optimally balances horizontal velocity and flight time because \(\sin(2\theta)\) is maximized at 1 when \(\theta = 45^\circ\). This balance ensures the projectile covers the greatest horizontal distance before landing.  

**Conclusion**:  
The range formula \(R \propto \sin(2\theta)\) shows that \(\sin(2\theta)\) peaks at 1 when \(\theta = 45^\circ\). Hence, this angle yields the maximum range under ideal conditions.

Let's dive into the physics of projectile motion.

When you throw a projectile at a 45° angle, its trajectory is determined by the balance of two forces: gravity (pulling it downwards) and the initial velocity (pushing it forward). To maximize the distance traveled, we want to take advantage of the horizontal component of the velocity while minimizing the effect of gravity's vertical component.

Here's what happens when you throw a projectile at different angles:

1. **Low angle (e.g., 10°):** The projectile travels a relatively short distance because the vertical component of the velocity (which is opposed by gravity) dominates, and the horizontal component is small.
2. **45° angle:** At this angle, the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity are equal. This means that the projectile's horizontal motion is maximized while its vertical motion is just sufficient to counteract gravity.
3. **High angle (e.g., 80°):** In this case, the vertical component of the velocity is larger than the horizontal component, which results in a shorter overall distance. The projectile has to travel higher, which means it will take longer to reach the ground, and the horizontal distance will be reduced due to the reduced time of flight.

Now, let's analyze the math behind this:

The initial velocity (v0) is a vector with both horizontal (vx) and vertical (vy) components. The horizontal component (vx) contributes to the distance traveled, while the vertical component (vy) affects the time of flight and the maximum height reached.

At a 45° angle, the horizontal and vertical components are equal: vx = vy = v0 / √2 (where v0 is the initial velocity).

When you project a projectile at a 45° angle, its range (R) is given by the equation:

R = (v0^2 \* sin(2θ)) / g

where θ is the angle of projection (45° in this case), v0 is the initial velocity, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Since sin(2 \* 45°) = sin(90°) = 1, the equation simplifies to:

R = v0^2 / g

This result shows that the range (R) is maximized when the angle of projection is 45°, which means that throwing a projectile at this angle produces the greatest possible distance.

In summary, throwing a projectile at a 45° angle produces the greatest possible distance because it balances the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity, allowing the projectile to travel the maximum horizontal distance while minimizing the effect of gravity's vertical component.
