We are to explain why a projectile launched at 45 degrees achieves the maximum range (horizontal distance) in the absence of air resistance.

 The motion of a projectile can be broken down into two independent components: horizontal and vertical.

 Horizontal motion: 
   The horizontal velocity (v_x) remains constant because there is no horizontal acceleration (assuming no air resistance). 
   So, v_x = v0 * cos(θ), where v0 is the initial speed and θ is the launch angle.

 Vertical motion:
   The vertical motion is affected by gravity. The initial vertical velocity is v0 * sin(θ). 
   The vertical acceleration is -g (downward). The projectile will go up and then come down.

 The time of flight (T) is the total time the projectile is in the air. We can find T by considering the vertical motion. 
 The time to reach the maximum height is when the vertical velocity becomes zero: 
    0 = v0 * sin(θ) - g * t_up   =>   t_up = (v0 * sin(θ)) / g.
 Since the motion is symmetric, the total time of flight T is twice that: 
    T = 2 * t_up = 2 * (v0 * sin(θ)) / g.

 The horizontal distance (range) R is given by:
    R = v_x * T = (v0 * cos(θ)) * [2 * (v0 * sin(θ)) / g]
      = (2 * v0^2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ)) / g.

 We can use the trigonometric identity: 2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ) = sin(2θ). 
 Therefore, 
    R = (v0^2 * sin(2θ)) / g.

 Now, we want to maximize R with respect to θ. Note that v0 and g are fixed.

 The range R is proportional to sin(2θ). The sine function has a maximum value of 1 when its argument is 90 degrees. 
 Therefore, sin(2θ) is maximized when 2θ = 90°, which implies θ = 45°.

 Hence, the maximum range is achieved when the launch angle is 45 degrees.

 However, note that this holds only when the launch and landing are at the same height. If the landing height is different (e.g., launching from a cliff), then the optimal angle may be different.

 But in the standard case (same level), 45° is optimal.

Throwing a projectile at a 45° angle maximizes the horizontal distance (range) due to the interplay between the horizontal and vertical components of motion, governed by the equations of projectile motion. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### 1. **Range Formula**:
   The range \( R \) of a projectile launched with initial speed \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \) is:
   \[
   R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
   \]
   where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( \sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta \).

### 2. **Key Insight**:
   The range \( R \) depends on \( \sin(2\theta) \). The sine function reaches its maximum value of **1** when its argument is **90°**:
   \[
   \sin(90^\circ) = 1.
   \]
   Thus, \( \sin(2\theta) \) is maximized when:
   \[
   2\theta = 90^\circ \implies \theta = 45^\circ.
   \]

### 3. **Why 45° Balances Components**:
   - **Horizontal Component**: \( v_{0x} = v_0 \cos\theta \) (constant motion).  
     A smaller \( \theta \) (e.g., 30°) gives a larger horizontal velocity but shorter flight time.
   - **Vertical Component**: \( v_{0y} = v_0 \sin\theta \) (affected by gravity).  
     A larger \( \theta \) (e.g., 60°) gives a longer flight time but smaller horizontal velocity.
   - **At 45°**:  
     \( \cos 45^\circ = \sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707 \).  
     This balance ensures the product of **horizontal velocity** and **flight time** is maximized.

### 4. **Flight Time and Velocity Trade-off**:
   - **Flight time** \( T = \frac{2v_0 \sin\theta}{g} \).  
   - **Range** \( R = (v_0 \cos\theta) \times T = (v_0 \cos\theta) \times \frac{2v_0 \sin\theta}{g} \).  
   - At 45°, \( \sin\theta \) and \( \cos\theta \) are equal, optimizing \( R \).

### 5. **Mathematical Proof**:
   - For \( \theta = 30^\circ \): \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.866 \) → \( R \approx 0.866 \frac{v_0^2}{g} \).  
   - For \( \theta = 45^\circ \): \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \) → \( R = \frac{v_0^2}{g} \) (maximum).  
   - For \( \theta = 60^\circ \): \( \sin(120^\circ) \approx 0.866 \) → same as 30°.  

### 6. **Practical Example**:
   If \( v_0 = 20 \) m/s and \( g = 10 \) m/s²:
   - At 30°: \( R = \frac{20^2 \sin(60^\circ)}{10} = 40 \times 0.866 \approx 34.6 \) m.  
   - At 45°: \( R = \frac{20^2 \sin(90^\circ)}{10} = 40 \times 1 = 40 \) m.  
   - At 60°: \( R = \frac{20^2 \sin(120^\circ)}{10} \approx 34.6 \) m.  

### 7. **Assumptions**:
   - Launch and landing heights are equal.  
   - No air resistance.  
   - Constant gravitational field \( g \).  

### Conclusion:
The 45° angle maximizes the range because it optimally balances the horizontal velocity (which decreases with angle) and the flight time (which increases with angle), resulting in the highest value of \( \sin(2\theta) \). This mathematical and physical principle holds universally under ideal conditions.

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks why throwing a projectile at a 45° angle produces the greatest possible distance.

## Step 2: Recall the basic principles of projectile motion
In projectile motion, the range (R) of a projectile is given by the equation R = (v0^2 * sin(2θ)) / g, where v0 is the initial velocity, θ is the angle of projection, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

## Step 3: Identify the key factor that determines the range
From the equation, we can see that the range is directly proportional to sin(2θ). Since sin(2θ) has a maximum value of 1, which occurs when 2θ = 90° or θ = 45°, this means that the range is maximum when the angle of projection is 45°.

## Step 4: Explain why 45° is the optimal angle
At a 45° angle, the vertical and horizontal components of the initial velocity are equal. As a result, the projectile has the longest range because it spends the most time in the air, allowing it to travel the farthest distance.

## Step 5: Summarize the reason for the greatest possible distance at 45°
Throwing a projectile at a 45° angle produces the greatest possible distance because it allows the projectile to spend the most time in the air, resulting in the longest range.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$
