We are to explain why a projectile, when thrown at a 45° angle, achieves the maximum range (horizontal distance) in the absence of air resistance.

 The motion of a projectile can be broken down into two independent components: horizontal and vertical.

 Horizontal motion: 
   The horizontal velocity (v_x) remains constant because there is no horizontal acceleration (assuming no air resistance). 
   So, v_x = v0 * cos(θ), where v0 is the initial speed and θ is the launch angle.

 Vertical motion:
   The vertical motion is affected by gravity. The initial vertical velocity is v0 * sin(θ). 
   The vertical acceleration is -g (downward). The time of flight is determined by the vertical motion.

 The total time of flight (T) can be found by considering the time when the projectile returns to the same vertical level (e.g., ground level). 
   The equation for vertical displacement at time t is: 
        y = (v0 * sin(θ)) * t - (1/2) * g * t^2
   When the projectile lands, y = 0 (if launched and landed at same level). So:
        0 = (v0 * sin(θ)) * T - (1/2) * g * T^2
   => T * [v0 * sin(θ) - (1/2) * g * T] = 0
   So, T = 0 (the start) or T = (2 * v0 * sin(θ)) / g.

 The horizontal distance (range) R is then:
        R = v_x * T = (v0 * cos(θ)) * (2 * v0 * sin(θ)) / g
          = (2 * v0^2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ)) / g

 We can use the trigonometric identity: sin(2θ) = 2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ) to rewrite:
        R = (v0^2 * sin(2θ)) / g

 Now, we want to maximize R with respect to θ. Note that v0 and g are fixed.

 Therefore, R is proportional to sin(2θ). The sine function has a maximum value of 1 when its argument is 90° (or π/2 radians). 
   So, sin(2θ) is maximized when 2θ = 90° => θ = 45°.

 Hence, the maximum range is achieved when θ = 45°.

 However, note that this derivation assumes that the launch and landing are at the same height. If the landing height is different, then the optimal angle may not be 45°.

 But in the standard case (same level), 45° gives the maximum range.

Throwing a projectile at a 45° angle maximizes the horizontal distance (range) due to the interplay between the horizontal and vertical components of motion, governed by the equations of projectile motion. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### 1. **Range Formula**:
   The range \( R \) of a projectile launched with initial speed \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \) (with respect to the horizontal) is given by:
   \[
   R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
   \]
   where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( \sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta \).

### 2. **Maximizing the Range**:
   - The range \( R \) depends on \( \sin(2\theta) \).
   - The sine function reaches its maximum value of 1 when its argument is \( 90^\circ \):
     \[
     \sin(2\theta) = 1 \implies 2\theta = 90^\circ \implies \theta = 45^\circ.
     \]
   - At \( \theta = 45^\circ \), \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \), so:
     \[
     R_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0^2}{g}.
     \]

### 3. **Why 45° is Optimal**:
   - **Horizontal vs. Vertical Trade-off**:
     - **Lower angles (e.g., 30°)**: The horizontal component \( v_0 \cos\theta \) is larger, but the vertical component \( v_0 \sin\theta \) is smaller. This results in a shorter time of flight, limiting the range despite higher horizontal speed.
     - **Higher angles (e.g., 60°)**: The vertical component is larger, increasing the time of flight. However, the horizontal component is smaller, so the projectile spends more time in the air but moves slower horizontally.
     - **45° angle**: Balances the horizontal speed and time of flight perfectly. The horizontal velocity and flight time are optimized such that their product (which determines the range) is maximized.

### 4. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The range formula \( R \propto \sin(2\theta) \) is symmetric around \( 45^\circ \). For example:
     - \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and \( \theta = 60^\circ \) both yield \( \sin(60^\circ) = \sin(120^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \), giving the same range (less than at 45°).
   - Only at \( \theta = 45^\circ \) does \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \), providing the absolute maximum.

### 5. **Key Assumption**:
   This result holds when the launch and landing heights are the same and air resistance is negligible. If the landing height differs (e.g., launching from a cliff), the optimal angle may not be 45°.

### Conclusion:
At 45°, the projectile achieves the ideal compromise between horizontal velocity and flight time, maximizing the range. This is mathematically confirmed by the maximum value of \( \sin(2\theta) \) occurring at \( \theta = 45^\circ \).

The reason throwing a projectile at a 45° angle results in the longest possible distance is due to the way the trajectory of the projectile is affected by the angle of launch.

When a projectile is thrown at an angle, it experiences two main forces: gravity and air resistance (which is negligible for most practical purposes). Gravity pulls the projectile downwards, while air resistance opposes its motion. The resulting trajectory of the projectile is a combination of these two forces.

The key factor is the vertical component of the initial velocity (v0). When the projectile is thrown at a 45° angle, the vertical component of v0 is equal to the horizontal component. This means that the time it takes for the projectile to reach its maximum height is equal to the time it takes to travel the horizontal distance.

To be more precise, let's denote the initial velocity as v0, the angle of launch as θ, and the acceleration due to gravity as g. The range (R) of the projectile can be calculated using the following equation:

R = (v0² \* sin(2θ)) / g

Here, sin(2θ) is the sine of the double angle, which is 1 for θ = 45°. This means that the range is maximized when θ = 45°.

In other words, when the projectile is thrown at a 45° angle, the vertical component of the initial velocity is just enough to counteract the effect of gravity, allowing the projectile to travel the maximum possible horizontal distance before hitting the ground.

This is a fundamental concept in physics, and it's why the baseball diamond is designed with 90° angles, maximizing the distance the ball travels when thrown at a 45° angle.

So, there you have it! The 45° angle results in the longest possible distance because it maximizes the range of the projectile by balancing the vertical and horizontal components of the initial velocity.
